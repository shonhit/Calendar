This was a group project for my Object Oriented Programming course. 
The GUI is built with the Java Swing library, and the design of the project follows the MVC pattern.
In the project assignment description, we were instructed to not attempt to create a visually appealing GUI
and to just focus on using knowledge gained throughout the semester to create an application that follows 
Object Oriented principles.

The entry point for the app is the SimpleCalendar.java file.
There is an events.txt file that will preload some events into the calendar once the application is started.
